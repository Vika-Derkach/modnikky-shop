            We also take fraud very seriously too, so all credit and debit card
            holders are subject to validation and authorisation by both us and
            the card issuer. To better protect our customers when making online
            payments by card you may be presented with 3D secure security
            measures when paying. This is dependent on your bank issuer and may
            require you to enter a password or get a security code via email or
            phone.
