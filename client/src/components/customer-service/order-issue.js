            Sales tax is calculated on the total of your order, after discount.
            The amount of tax charged to your order depends on your delivery
            address. The tax is calculated based on state rates and the items
            you are purchasing. We'll always show you how much Sales Tax you'll
            be charged when you go to checkout.
